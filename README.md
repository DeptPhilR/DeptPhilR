- 👋 Hi, I’m @DeptPhilR
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything, but I used to love front end, ended up doing lots of integration, moved then into consulting and now back at an Agency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Contentful, AWS, back into some node.js
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nowt as I'm way too busy.
- 📫 How to reach me ... that would be telling.
